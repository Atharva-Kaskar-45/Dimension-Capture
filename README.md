# Dimension Capture

Dimension Capture is a cost-effective smartphone application designed to measure dimensions of objects with high accuracy. By leveraging computer vision and ArUco markers with open-source tools like OpenCV, the app offers a reliable alternative to expensive LiDAR systems.

Features: Utilizes smartphone cameras to capture depth data and calculate object dimensions (width and length) with advanced image processing.
Performance: Achieves an average measurement error below 5% and processes measurements in under 0.9 seconds.
Applications: Ideal for logistics, manufacturing, and e-commerce sectors requiring precise object sizing.

Dimension Capture simplifies measurement practices, making accurate dimensioning accessible to businesses of all sizes.

This is 100% working model but in order to enhance the user experience, we are currently developing a kotlin application for this project. 
Right now we are in the designing phase of the project using Figma.
