# Dimension-Capture-with-ArUco-Marker

Accurate dimension measurement is critical in sectors like logistics, 
manufacturing, and e-commerce, where object sizing directly impacts eAiciency. 
Traditionally, industries have depended on costly laser-based LiDAR systems, 
often unaAordable for smaller businesses. This paper introduces Dimension 
Capture, a smartphone application that uses computer vision and ArUco markers 
to provide a cost-eAective, accurate alternative for dimension measurement. 
Utilizing common smartphone hardware and open-source tools like OpenCV, 
Dimension Capture enables quick, reliable measurement of cuboid objects. The 
app captures images to gather depth data, automatically calculating object width 
and length with advanced image processing to enhance precision. Tests in varied 
real world settings show an average measurement error below 5% and a 
processing time of 0.89 seconds per measurement. This study discusses 
Dimension Captureâ€™s technology, applications, and potential to revolutionize 
measurement practices.
